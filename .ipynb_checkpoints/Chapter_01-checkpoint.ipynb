    "The .npy format is very efficient for storage and takes very little memory on your computer. However, it can only be read by python. If you wanted something that's 'human-readable', meaning something that you could double-click and read on a device that doesn't have python (or if you want to share data with a colleague), you can instead save in the .txt or .csv (comma separated values) or .tsv (tab separated values) formats. In these cases, use `np.savetxt(\"filename.txt\",arrayname, delimiter=\",\")` or `np.savetxt(\"filename.csv\",arrayname, delimiter=\",\")` or `np.savetxt(\"filename.csv\",arrayname, delimiter=\"\\t\")`, respectively. The `delimiter` tells python to put a comma or a tab space after each entry so other programs (like Excel or text editors) can recognize individual entries easily. And you can load these files via `newarrayname=np.loadtxt(\"filename.csv\", delimiter=\",\")` etc.\n",

Similarly, we can skip rows or selectively extract columns using the `usecols` and `skiprows` arguments. For example, `np.loadtxt(\"filename.csv\", delimiter=',',dtype='str', usecols=[2],skiprows=2)` would load data type string from the third column only and it would skip the first 2 rows. Many more careful loading manipulations are possible using other arguments; for details, look in the [numpy loadtxt documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html)."
