    "Almost all solutions you will develop in this course will involve inserting `if` and related statements into loops, or having both conditionals and loops in functions. As an example, consider the Fibonacci series that appears in a variety of natural patterns (flower petal arrangements, pineapple patterns, artichoke petals, .... look it up). Each new number in the series is the sum of the last two (starts as 0,1,1,2,3,..). Algorithmically, if we call `a` and `b` as the previous and current numbers, then the new number is `c=b+a`. A quick way of getting the first 10 numbers is, without even introducing a new variable `c`, is:"
