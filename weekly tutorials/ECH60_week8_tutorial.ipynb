    "Integration gives a cumulative measure of the data or function. With time dependent functions (like velocity), integration gives the sum of small bits of the function added up at every step of the independent variable (so adding up velocity times time at every instant gives total distance travelled). With spatially-varying functions (like concentration or density, ...), integration gives the total valiue over a specified range (total number of molecules, total mass etc, ...). Geometrically, integration provides the area under a curve. In analogy with finite differences to approximate derivatives, we can think of finite 'sums' to add up bits at every point to get the total area or the total integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know how to analytically obtain integrals of simple functions. But, much like differentiation, some functions are too complicated (or even impossible) to integrate by hand and require a numerical approach to approximate. Similarly, discrete measurement or data points can be integrated numerically using finite sums without knowing the functional relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
